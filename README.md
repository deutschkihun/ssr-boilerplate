# Server side rendering (SSR) 
> Server side rendering is the process of taking a client-side javascript framework website and rendering it to static HTML and CSS on the **server**. 
SSR is very useful for fast loading (rendering) websites. By using SSR, HTML will be generated on the server and send that donw to the browser. 


# Advantage of SSR ( compare with Client side rendering (CSR))


## Structure

> This project consists of following file structure. 


    * controllers: controlling different endpoints (URIS) by find,query ... 
    
    * db: database connection file by using mongoose.connection()
    
    * error: custom error handling file by extending from "Error" class.
    
    * middleware: It has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), 
      and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. 
    
    * models: Mongo DB Schema file. This file will be used to build a collection(table) in database. 
    
    * routes: Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, 
      which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).
    
    * .env: environmentent variable file. This file contains MONGO_URI for mongodb connection. This file has to be secured.
      Therefore, make sure that this file should not be pushed in to remote branch. (Always be a member of gitignore) 
    
    * app.js: project starting file. If you run this project, app.js will be executed first.
